		<t>
		0-RTT mechanisms reduce the time it takes for the first bytes
		of application data to be processed in a transport connection
		and can greatly reduce connection latency during setup. </t>

		<t>The 0-RTT transport features described by quic-transport help
		clients establish secure connections with a minimal number of
		round-trips.  This document describes additional transport
		parameters that can help a connection that continues after
		an interuption by caching and sharing connection properties
		for use when the connection resumes.

		<section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">
			<t> QUIC supports the sending of data in two different
			modes, after the transport handshake has completed,
			1-RTT mode, and sending data along with handshake
			packets, 0-RTT mode.  By using 0-RTT data an
			application is able to send data with the handshake
			packets, making it possible to reduce the latency
			of the connection setup. </t>

			<t> A QUIC server must store a copy of a number of flow
			control related transport parameters to enable the use
			of 0-RTT data. Due to the nature of flow control in
			QUIC it is possible that by omitting or setting one of
			these parameter to zero a connection will be created,
			but it will not be possible for any data to be sent.
			</t>

			<t> For 0-RTT data to be sent, the QUIC server must
			record the values of:</t>

			<t><list style="symbols">
				<t>initial_max_data</t>
				<t>initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local</t>
				<t>initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote</t>
				<t>initial_max_stream_data_uni</t>
				<t>initial_max_streams_bidi</t>
				<t>initial_max_streams_uni</t>
			</list></t>

			<t> These values set the flow control limits that a
			connection must operation within. The server has to
			store these parameters so that a client resuming during
			0-RTT is able to send data. The stored values are used
			for any data that is transmitted before the handshake
			has completed and 1-RTT data is able to be sent on the
			connection.  Once the handshake has completed these
			values are discarded and the values established during
			the handshake are used.</t>

			<t>This document proposes an extension to the transport
			parameters that are shared during the 0-RTT phase to
			allow resumption using transport and connection
			properties that were discovered in previous
			connections. These additional parameters aim to provide
			faster startup of flows and better buffer management.
			The BDP metadata extension is proposed and candidate
			parameters are discussed in <xref
			target="sec:bdp_metadata"></xref>.</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sec:rationale" title="Motivation">
			<t> Reducing the number of round-trips required to
			start a connection is an important way to reduce setup
			time and lower overall connection latency. 0-RTT
			mechanisms that allow a client to get feed requests to
			a server in the first RTT do not alone improve the
			total time-to-service. The BDP extension described in
			this document aims to improve traffic delivery by
			allowing the connection to short cut slow RTT based
			processes that grow connection parameters.</t>

			<t>Currently each side has its proprietary solution to
			measure and to store path characteristics. Recalling
			the parameters of a previous connection would allow:
			<list style="symbols">
					<t>Server and client can re-initialise
					the state from previously established
					parameters (i.e., minRTT, MTU,
					bottleneck capacity, etc.)</t>

					<t>The client to prepare the
					right resources</t>

					<t>Server side adaptation to
					non-default path
					characteristics</t>
			</list></t>
		</section>
				
		<section anchor="sec:bdp_metadata" title="BDP metadata parameters">
			<t>Section 7.3.1 of <xref
			target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"></xref> describes the
			parameters that must be remembered if a client wants to
			send 0-RTT data.  Both endpoints store the value of the
			server transport parameters from a connection and apply
			them to any 0-RTT packets that are sent in subsequent
			connections to that peer. Of the six mandatory
			parameters, only initial_max_data improves the
			time-to-service of the 0-RTT connection. The BDP
			metadata extension augments the list of server
			transport parameters that are shared with the client to
			improve the time-to-service and save resource such as
			CPU, memory and power.</t>

			<t>The BDP extension proposes three new parameters that
			help a connection startup in aminimal number of
			RTTs:<list style="symbols">

				<t>recon_bytes_in_flight (0x000X): The bytes in
				flight measured on the previous connection by
				the server. Integer number of bytes.
				Using the bytes_in_flight defined in <xref
				target="I-D.ietf-quic-recovery"></xref>,
				recon_bytes_in_flight can be set to
				bytes_in_flight.</t>

				<t>recon_min_rtt (0x000X): The minimum RTT
				measured on the previous connection by the
				server. Integer number of milliseconds. Using
				the min_rtt defined in <xref
				target="I-D.ietf-quic-recovery"></xref>,
				recon_min_rtt can be set to min_rtt.</t>

				<t>recon_max_pkt_number (0x000X): The maximum
				amount of packets that the server is allowed to
				send when reconnecting. It is an integer in
				unit of packets.</t>
			</list></t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sec:bdp_activation" title="Extension activation">
			<t>The BDP extension is protected by the same mechanism
			that protects the exchange of the 0-RTT transport
			parameters.  A client that activates 0-RTT data sends
			back the transport parameters received from the server
			during the previous connection (see Section 7.3.1 of
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"></xref>).  </t>

			<t>The client MUST read the parameters in the BDP
			metadata extension but can not change them.</t>

			<t>Accept: A client that activates ingress optimization
			SHOULD send back the transport parameters of the BDP
			metadata extension that it received from the server
			during the previous connection.</t>

			<t>Refuse: A client which does not support ingress
			optimisation drops the extension signal. A client which
			disagrees with the extension parameters received from
			the server refuses the optimization.</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="sec:other_parameter" title="Discussion">
			<t>The recon_bytes_in_flight parameter is higher than
			the number of bytes in the actual BDP since it may
			include bytes in buffers along the path. </t>

			<t>The recon_bytes_in_flight parameter is
			an indication of the end-to-end BDP that is
			experienced by the congestion control. If the
			recon_bytes_in_flight is high, the server may decide to
			increase the maximum amount of packets it will send
			when reconnecting using the recon_max_pkt_number
			parameter. </t>

			<t>The maximum number of initial data packets
			that can be sent without acknowledgement needs to be
			chosen to avoid congestion collapse. An example of a
			server solution is proposed in <xref
			target="appendix-server"></xref>. In short:
			<list style="symbols">
				<t>recon_bytes_in_flight indicates the
				characteristics of the network underneath to
				both peers that can adapt their buffer sizes or
				parameter tuning.</t>

				<t>recon_min_rtt lets both client and server
				know the minimum RTT of the previous
				connection. Parameters can then be adapted
				(e.g. adapt how kInitialRtt is used in the
				"Setting the Loss Detection Timer" section of
				<xref
				target="I-D.ietf-quic-recovery"></xref>).</t>

				<t>recon_max_pkt_number lets the server warn
				the client that it may increase the amount of
				packets that it expects to send when
				reconnecting. This value is negotiated with the
				client and result in better buffer management
				and reduced flow start up.</t>
			</list></t>

			<t>Other parameters can contribute to the optimization
			of 0-RTT connection. There are good candidates, like
			max_ack_delay, in the Appendix of <xref
			target="I-D.ietf-quic-recovery"></xref>. </t>

		<!-- <t>Another paramater that could be added to the BDP metadata extension could be the ack_ratio.<list style="symbols">
				<t>ack_ratio (0x000X): The acknowledgment ratio that has been used at the end of the previous connection by the server. It is an integer in unit of packets.</t></list></t> 
			<t>Starting with a high ACK ratio may induce bursts of packet in a potentially congested network. That being said, keeping a low ack_ratio may limit performance in case of asymmetry <xref target="PANRG106"></xref>. The server may want to be recalled the ACK ratio that had been used at the end of the connection but not use it when starting the 0-RTT conection.</t> -->

			<t> The BDP metadata parameters are measured by the server made during a previous connection.</t>
			<t> BDP extension is protected by the mechanism which protect the exchange of the 0-RTT transport parameters. For the version 1 of QUIC, the BDP extension is protected using the mechanism which already protects the "initial_max_data" parameter. It is defined in sections 4.5 to 4.7 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-tls"></xref>. It provides the server with a mean to check that the parameters proposed by the client are those the server sent to the client during the previous connexion.</t>

			<t>This section details a solution at the server to safely increase the maximum amount of packets that the server sends when receiving a 0-RTT packet from a client.</t>
			<t>The server keeps a standard initial window to avoid adding congestion to a congested network. After the reception of the acknowledgments for the last packet of the initial window, the server checks that the min_rtt is consistent.
