		<t>
		0-RTT mechanisms reduce the time it takes for the first bytes
		of application data to be processed in a transport connection
		and can greatly reduce connection latency during setup.
		The 0-RTT transport features described by quic-transport help
		clients establish secure connections with a minimal number of
		round-trips.
		</t>
		<t>
		This document describes a generic method to exchange path parameters relating to transport.
		The additional transport parameters can help a connection that continues after
			an interruption or restarts by sharing connection properties.
			 This can help servers to adapt to non-default path characteristics and to short-cut slow RTT-based processes.
		This document discusses safety guidelines that should be considered when using these parameters for increasing egress traffic.

		<section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">

			<t>
			Each transport connection typically starts without
			knowledge of the path between the endpoints. Transport
			protocols use implicit signals from the network to
			discover the properties of the path. This information
			is used to adapt the transport mechanisms to the
			network path. For example, an Internet transport
			endpoint is unable to determine a safe rate at which to
			start or continue their transmission, and uses
			slow-start to determine a safe rate. This applies to the 
			1-RTT mode of QUIC.
			</t>

			<t>This document aims to improve traffic delivery by
			allowing the connection to short-cut slow RTT-based
			processes that grow connection parameters. This can
			result in significant web browsing experience improvement
			and short file downloading time reduction.</t>

			<t>Section 7.3.1 of <xref
			target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"></xref> describes the 
			parameters that must be remembered if a client wishes to
			send 0-RTT data.  Both endpoints store the value of the
			server transport parameters from a previous connection and apply
			them to any 0-RTT packets that are sent in subsequent
			connections to the same peer. Of the six mandatory
			parameters, only initial_max_data improves the
				time-to-service of the 0-RTT connection.</t>

			<t>In addition to these parameters, this document proposes an extension to augment the list of server transport parameters that are shared with the client to improve the time-to-service. This allows resumption using additionnal transport and connection properties that were discovered in previous connections during the 0-RTT phase. Candidate parameters are Round-Trip Time (RTT) and network Bottleneck Bandwidth (BB). Network conditions may change during 1-RTT and 0-RTT: safety guidelines on how to safely apply to previously measured parameters to 0-RTT connections.</t>

			<t>
				As a summary, this document proposes :<list style="symbols">
					<t>QUIC transport parameters to exchange the measured BDP in the 1-RTT	connection for 0-RTT connections;</t>
					<t>A simple test to 
						verify whether the previous conditions apply;</t>
					<t>Implementation considerations for QUIC.</t>

		<section anchor="subsec:rationale_jump" title="Safe jump start">

			<section title="Rationale behind the safety guidelines">

				<t>The server should carefully exploit internal evaluations of the bytes in flight and minimum RTT to assess the BDP. Previously measured BDP should not be used as-is to avoid congestion collapse: <list style="symbols">
					<t>The bytes in flight parameter that could be recalled from previous connection may be higher than the number of bytes in the BDP such as defined in <xref target="RFC6349"></xref> since it may include bytes in buffers along the path.</t>
					<t>Network conditions may vary between 1-RTT and 0-RTT connections.</t>
					</list></t>

				<t>While safety recommandations are necessary, it seems important to note that CDNs currently exploit a very high Initial Window <xref target="TMA18"></xref>.</t>

			</section> 

			<section anchor="safety_guide" title="Safety guidelines">
<t>If the client accepts the extension, the server could increase the initial congestion window. The proposed mechanisms SHOULD be limited by any rate-limitation mechanisms of QUIC, such as flow control mechanisms or amplification attacks prevention. In particular, the maximum number of packets that can be sent without acknowledgment needs to be chosen to avoid the creation and the increase of congestion to a congested network. Moreover, the extension should not be an opportunity for the current connection to be a vector of an amplification attack. The address validation process, used to prevent amplification attacks, SHOULD be considered <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"></xref>.</t>

			<t>The following scenario is considered:</t>
			<t><list style="numbers">
				<t>First connection without 0-RTT: the server stores parameters related to round-trip time and maximum data rate in the Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) extension frame;</t>
				<t>During the first connection: the server sends the BDP extensions frame to the client - both client and server can read the content of the BDP extension;</t>
				<t>Second connection with 0-RTT: if the client agrees with the parameters, it sends the BDP extension along with 0-RTT packets;</t>
				<t>Second connection with 0-RTT: the servers sends a standard initial window - this can be considered a safe starting poing for an unknown path to avoid adding congestion to a congested network;</t>
				<t>Second connection with 0-RTT: if the reception of IW is
					confirmed for the first RTT of data,
					and also the path is determined to be
					similar to that of a recent previous
					session (e.g., similar RTT), the method
					permits the sender to use the previous
					path information as an input to help
					determine a new safe rate;</t>
							<t>Another
					safety net could be the pacing of
					packets as a function of the estimated
							RTT.</t>
			</list></t>

				<t>This follows the idea of <xref target="RFC4782"></xref>, <xref target="I-D.irtf-iccrg-sallantin-initial-spreading"></xref> and <xref target="CONEXT15"></xref>.</t>

			<t>Network conditions may vary between 1-RTT and 0-RTT connections. <xref target="RFC6349"></xref> defines the BDP as follows: "Derived from Round-Trip Time (RTT) and network Bottleneck Bandwidth (BB), the Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP) determines the Send and Received Socket buffer sizes required to achieve the maximum TCP Throughput." The 1-RTT connection may not reproduce the procedure detailed in <xref target="RFC6349"></xref> to measure the BDP. The server may exploit internal evaluations of the bytes in flight and minimum RTT to assess the BDP. As a result, the estimation of the BDP of the server would include the buffering in the network and would not be accurate. Moreover, network conditions may vary between 1-RTT and 0-RTT connections.</t>
       
			<t>The BDP extension proposes two new parameters
			<list style="symbols">

				<t>recon_bytes_in_flight (0x000X): The bytes in
				flight measured on the previous connection by
				the server. Integer number of bytes.
				Using the previous values of bytes_in_flight defined in <xref
				target="I-D.ietf-quic-recovery"></xref>,
					recon_bytes_in_flight could be determined.</t>

				<t>recon_min_rtt (0x000X): The minimum RTT
				measured on the previous connection by the
				server. Integer number of milliseconds. Using
				the min_rtt defined in <xref
				target="I-D.ietf-quic-recovery"></xref>,
				recon_min_rtt can be set to min_rtt. The min_rtt 
				parameter may not track a decreasing RTT: the 
				min_rtt that is reported here may not be the 
				actual minimum RTT measured during the 1-RTT 
				connection, but still reflects the characteristics 
				of the latency on the network.

		<section anchor="sec:bdp_activation" title="Extension activation">
			<t>The BDP extension is protected by the same mechanism
			that protects the exchange of the 0-RTT transport
			parameters.  A client that activates 0-RTT data sends
			back the transport parameters received from the server
			during the previous connection (see Section 7.3.1 of
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"></xref>).  </t>

			<t>The client reads the parameters in the BDP
			metadata extension, but can not change them.</t>

			<t>Accept: A client MAY use the extension parameters. 
			Then, it activates ingress optimization 
			and sends back the transport parameters of the BDP
			metadata extension that it received from the server
			during the previous connection.</t>

			<t>Refuse: A client could choose not to use these parameters. 
			Then, it does not support ingress
			optimisation and drops the extension signal. A client that
			disagrees with the extension parameters received from
			the server refuses the optimization.</t>

		<section title="Discussion">

			<section title="Applicability of the BDP extension">
				<t>This section discusses that applicability of the BDP extension.</t>
				<t>The following events could make the BDP extension inappropriate:<list style="symbols">
<t>IP address changes: If the client changes its IP address, it may employ a different network to reconnect. The new path may not exhibit the same characteristics as the old one.</t>
<t>Rate-limitation induced by QUIC: The proposed mechanisms SHOULD be limited by other rate-limitation mechanisms of QUIC, such as the address validation process that is used to prevent amplification attacks <xref target="I-D.ietf-quic-transport"></xref>.</t>
					<t>Lifetime of the extension: Based on experimental feedback and to reduce resource utilization at the client, the BDP extension may be proposed with a lifetime that could be changed. This follows the idea of NewSessionTicket of TLS <xref target="RFC8446"></xref>.</t>
				</list></t>
<t>That being said, exploiting the safety nets proposed in <xref target="safety_guide"></xref> would reduce any harm that could be caused by using inappropriate BDP parameters. The safety guidelines reduce the gains brought by the proposed approach, but limit the risks of adding congestion in a congested network.</t>
			</section>

			<section anchor="subsec:other_param_bdp_protect" title="BDP extension protected as much as initial_max_data">
				<t>The BDP metadata parameters are measured by
					the server during a previous
					connection. The BDP extension is
					protected by the mechanism that
					protects the exchange of the 0-RTT
					transport parameters. For the version 1
					of QUIC, the BDP extension is protected
					using the mechanism that already
					protects the "initial_max_data"
					parameter.  This is defined in sections
					4.5 to 4.7 of <xref

					It provides the server with a way to

			<section anchor="subsec:other_param_client_pov" title="The client point-of-view">
				<t>The client can read the values of the

			<section anchor="sec:rationale" title="Other use-cases">
	
			<section anchor="subsec:rationale_client" title="Optimizing client's requests">
				<t>In cases with Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTPS (DASH), clients may encounter issues in knowing the available bandwidth or DASH can encounter issues in reaching the best available video playback quality. The client's requests could be adapted and specific traffic could use information from the paths characteristics (such as trying to impress the client with high quality videos, to fill the buffers and avoid video blocking or to send high quality adds).</t>
				<t>In other cases, applications may provide additionnal services if clients can know the server's estimation of the path characteristics.</t>
		</section>

		<section anchor="subsec:rationale_sharing" title="Sharing transport information accross multiple connections">
				<t>There is an interest in sharing transport
				information across multiple
