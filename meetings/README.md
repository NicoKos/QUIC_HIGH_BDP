# Quic4Sat side meeting at IETF-106

There are multiple drafts related to the performance of QUIC over large BDP networks
(draft -kuhn-quic-4-sat, draft-kuhn-quic-0rtt-bdp, draft-ietf-quic-recovery) or related to the performance
of encrypted protocols in general (draft-fairhurst-tsvwg-cc). The objective of this workshop is to gather 
people interested in such activity and discuss the best way towards better end user experience in this use case.
